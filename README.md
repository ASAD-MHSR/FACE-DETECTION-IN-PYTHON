# FACE-DETECTION-IN-PYTHON
This project utilizes Python to implement a simple yet effective face detection system using the OpenCV library. The aim of the project is to demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be applied to real-time computer vision tasks, specifically detecting human faces in images or video streams.




How to Run

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/AXAD-MHSR/face-detection.git
cd face-detection

Set Up the Environment:

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless

Run the Script:

python main.py

Usage:

Real-Time Mode: Use your webcam to detect faces.

Image Mode: Edit the script to process a specific image file.

Exit: Press the 'a' key to quit the application during runtime.

Requirements

Python 3.x

OpenCV library

That's it! You're ready to detect faces!
