# FACE-DETECTION-IN-PYTHON
This project utilizes Python to implement a simple yet effective face detection system using the OpenCV library. The aim of the project is to demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be applied to real-time computer vision tasks, specifically detecting human faces in images or video streams.
